# Twitter Forest
## Weekly Challenge
### Week Nine
 
The challenge this week was to create an app from scratch. We were assigned teams, and worked on it all week.
 
Our project was designed to create a forest of trees that grows when a tweet is mentioned.
 
We'd originally started the project in Rails, but then made the decision to rewrite it in Javascript.
 
Technologies used:
-------
- Javascript
- Jquery
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Twitter API
- Jasmine for testing
 
User Stories:

As a member of the woodland folk
So that I can track my interests in an environment that I recognise
I'd like the visual representation to be as a tree in a forest
